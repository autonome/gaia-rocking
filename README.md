# Gaia Rocking...

This repo is a shell you can use to set up a Gaia hacking environment.

Current status notes:

* OS X only ( so far, Linux should be easy )
* nothing works yet
* everything is written in node.js
* intended featured include:
** updating B2G.app
** updating Gaia as a git submodule
** adding your own apps as submodules
** some cool method of pushing custom apps(s) to the gaia profile's appcache.
** running B2G desktop from a helper .app using AppleScript.

** DISCLAIMER **: this is opinioated and badly written software. Pull requests welcome, but if you don;t like node or you do run Windaz, might be best to create your own equally opinionated version.

## Future possibilities:

* automate creating an app shell using jrburkes responsive-template or longster's mason?
